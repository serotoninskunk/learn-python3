    "## [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) aka TDD\n",
    "In short, the basic idea of TDD is to write tests before writing the actual implementation. Maybe the most significant benefit of the approach is that the developer focuses on writing tests which match with what the program should do. Whereas if the tests are written after the actual implementation, there is a high risk for rushing tests which just show green light for the already written logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests are first class citizens in modern, agile software development, which is why it's important to start thinking TDD early during your Python learning path. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow of TDD can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. Add a test case(s) for the change / feature / bug fix you are going to implement\n",
    "2. Run all tests and check that the new one fails\n",
    "3. Implement required changes\n",
    "4. Run tests and verify that all pass\n",
    "5. Refactor"
